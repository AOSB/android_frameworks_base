AOSB Project BASE
====
I know everyone believes in open source, and we do as well. There is a huge difference in picking features and adding them to your work, and renaming a whole project then calling it your own. We hate having to add this in here, but it's a hard lesson learned from the past.

As AOSB Project has grown exponentially over the last 5 months or so, we have run into many issues with user/developers asking if they can use the source from AOSB github for their own projects and/or make official/unofficial builds. In this document we will try to set forth some basic policies to help with any questions.
 
 
#### AOSB Project Sharing Policy

AOSB Project gives full rights for users to make unofficial builds of AOSB from our github source code. These unofficial builds are limited to being posted in forums only if a device is not supported and we do not have a download link provided. When creating an unofficial build do not be surprised if you are approached by member of the AOSB team and asked to submit your device files and possibly join our team. We encourage this behavior and promote learning and helping where ever possible.
 
Private builds are given full rights to use AOSB Project source to build and use on their personal devices. These may be modified however you see fit, but we ask that you DO NOT distribute on a large scale (posting on forums, etc...)
 
Official builds are limited to AOSB Project members to distribute freely in their official threads. Posting an official thread without being a member will result in eventually having your thread reported and possibly removed. (This is a respect thing)

### Cherry-Picking
* AOSB Project are open source and as we cherry picked a lot of features from many different sources, we encourage you to do the same. Either from us or from the direct source. We ask that you keep the Author of the original commit within your cherry-pick and give credits where credits are due. We all work very hard on all our projects and everyone is owed that respect.

### Rebasing
* The use of AOSB Project as a base for your Rom is FORBIDDEN. This includes...forking all our repos, changing a few apks, changing the wallpaper and boot animation, and then renaming our work to a new name. If you wish to use our Rom as a base, I suggest you spend the days, weeks, and months it took to put this project together and do it yourself.

### Winzipped ROMS
* We do not allow any winzipped Roms OF ANY KIND when it comes to AOSB. We do not allow ports from one device to another. We only allow source built Roms and that is it. Any winzipped Roms under the AOSB Project name will be reported.
 
 
### Rom/Code Policy
* Everyone is free to add code to AOSB Project. Please do so via pull request. Once an official thread is created for AOSB Project, we ask that it stay an official thread...this means that if for some reason you decide to leave the AOSB team that you either close your thread and let another member take over the official thread, or you transfer the thread over to another member. Any code that you have added will remain in AOSB Project and, as always, any feature is free to cherry-pick as well.
